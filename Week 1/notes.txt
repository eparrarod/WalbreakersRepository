ArrayOrder: I stated using two loops to fill out the array. But since it was too much coe I decided to do a nested loop to traverse the array. If the element found is even, go to the next one. If it is odd, then find the next even number in the array and swap them. Repeat until the end of the array or no more even numbers are found after finding an odd number.

Transpose: I had problems making my solution work because I made it in place for square matrices. It took me a few debugging attemps to realize the inputs where not always square matrices. At that point I modified it to work by creating a new matrix with the mirrored dimensions and copying the original matrix.
